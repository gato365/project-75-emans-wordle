To effectively manage your project on Jira, it's essential to structure your tasks systematically. Below, I outline a recommended set of tasks, organized into epics and sprints, to help guide your team through the development of a Wordle-like game using Django. This structure aims to cover all aspects of the project from setup, development, to deployment.

### Epics and Corresponding Tasks

#### Epic 1: Project Setup
- **Task 1.1:**  Set up the Django project environment.
- **Task 1.2:** Configure virtual environments for Python to manage dependencies.
- **Task 1.3:** [Establish version control with Git and link the repository to Jira.

#### Epic 2: Database Configuration
- **Task 2.1:** Design the database schema for game data, user profiles, and game history.


    - Option 2: All models (Epic 3)
        - User Model
        - Game Model
        - GameHistory Model
        - DailyChallenge Model
        - Score Model
        - Progression Model
        - UserProgression Model
        - UserScore Model
        - UserGameHistory Model
        - UserDailyChallenge Model
- **Task 2.2:** Set up models in Django.
- **Task 2.3:** Configure Django admin for model management.








#### Epic 3: User Authentication
- **Task 3.1:** Implement user registration and login pages.
     
     - Setup Google OAuth for Registration and Login (late in development)


- **Task 3.2:** Set up user session management.
- **Task 3.3:** Integrate third-party authentication (e.g., Google, Facebook).

#### Epic 4: Game Logic Development
- **Task 4.1:** Develop the backend logic for generating daily challenges.
- **Task 4.2:** Implement the logic to check user input against the solution.
- **Task 4.3:** Create a scoring and progression system.

#### Epic 5: User Interface Development
- **Task 5.1:** Design the main game interface using HTML/CSS.
- **Task 5.2:** Implement responsive frontend interactions with JavaScript.
- **Task 5.3:** Ensure accessibility standards are met in the UI design.

#### Epic 6: Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Task 6.1:** Write unit tests for the models and game logic.
- **Task 6.2:** Implement integration tests for the entire application.
- **Task 6.3:** Conduct usability testing with potential users.

#### Epic 7: Deployment and Maintenance
- **Task 7.1:** Set up a staging environment for pre-live testing.
- **Task 7.2:** Deploy the application to a production environment.
- **Task 7.3:** Plan and implement a maintenance schedule for server and database management.

### Sprints

- **Sprint 1: Setup and Initial Development**
  - Include tasks from Epic 1 and initial tasks from Epics 2 and 3.

- **Sprint 2: Core Functionality Development**
  - Focus on completing Epics 3, 4, and begin Epic 5.

- **Sprint 3: Interface and Interaction**
  - Complete Epic 5 and start Epic 6.

- **Sprint 4: Testing and Deployment**
  - Focus on completing Epic 6 and all tasks in Epic 7.

### Additional Considerations

- **Meetings:** Schedule regular sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and sprint review meetings.
- **Documentation:** Ensure that each task includes sub-tasks for documentation and review.
- **Feedback Loop:** Implement a feedback mechanism after each sprint to incorporate learnings and improvements.

Each task in your Jira should be clearly defined with acceptance criteria, estimated hours, assigned team member(s), and necessary tags or labels for easy tracking. This structured approach will help ensure that all project facets are addressed methodically and efficiently.
