## Meeting Notes (with Robbert)


### **Project Management Methodologies**
1. **Waterfall**: A linear, sequential approach where the project flows downwards through phases such as conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

2. **Agile**:
   - **Philosophy**: Values individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan.
   - **Types**:
     - **Scrum**:
       - **Ceremonies**: Includes daily standups, bi-weekly sprint planning, sprint reviews, and sprint retrospectives.
       - **Roles**: Development teams, Scrum Master, Product Owner.
       - **Artifacts**: Product backlog, sprint backlog, product increments.
       - **Practices**: Ticket grooming (3 amigos: developer, product, QA), story points estimation, team velocity tracking, burndown charts.
       - **Estimation**: Uses the Fibonacci series to estimate effort.
     - **Kanban**:
       - Focuses on visualizing work, limiting work in progress, and maximizing flow. Does not typically use sprints or story points but focuses on continuous delivery.

### **Types of Work Items**
1. **Epic**: A large body of work that can span multiple sprints, often containing many user stories, tasks, and other work items.

2. **Stories**: Measurable units of work that provide value to the customer. Types include:
   - **User Stories**: Requirements or features written from the perspective of an end user.
   - **Technical Stories**: Tasks that involve backend, architectural, or infrastructural work that may not deliver direct user-facing value but are necessary for the system.
   - **Bug Stories**: Work items that involve fixing errors or issues in the system.

3. **Tasks**: Smaller units of work that contribute to completing a story but are not directly measurable from the customer’s perspective.

4. **Spike Tasks**: Research tasks that are required to gain knowledge necessary to reduce the risk of a technical approach, better understand a requirement, or increase the reliability of a story estimate.

### **Project Workflow Concepts**
- **Swimlanes**: Categories in Kanban or Scrum boards that allow similar tasks to be grouped and visualized, helping manage tasks that occur in parallel.
- **Reproducible Tasks for Words**: Likely tasks related to the consistent implementation or testing of text-based features or content.

### **Roles**
- **Lead Designer**: Responsible for the overall design vision and execution of the product.
- **QA (Quality Assurance)**: Ensures the product meets quality standards and functions as intended.
- **Tech Lead**: Oversees the technical aspects of the project, ensuring architectural and operational guidelines are followed.
- **Product Manager**: Manages the product’s lifecycle, focusing on delivering value to the customers.
- **People Manager**: Manages team dynamics, personnel issues, and ensures a productive working environment.
- **Teacher**: Provides training and education to team members, enhancing skills and spreading knowledge.
